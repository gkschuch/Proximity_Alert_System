# Proximity Alert System


A real-time desktop dashboard built with Python (PySide6) and an Arduino to monitor distance using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. The application provides instant visual feedback through a color-coded display and LEDs, and logs events when an object enters a predefined "danger zone".
