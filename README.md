# Proximity Alert System


This project is an application that provides real-time distance monitoring using an Arduino and an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. The interface, built with Python and the PySide6 framework, displays the current distance with color-coded visual alerts. To ensure a record of critical events, the system automatically logs a timestamped entry to a CSV file whenever an object enters a predefined 'danger zone'.
